Added Home_Visits_Vaccination, this is a project I've been working on, originally I started it trying to copy some of the user interfaces that Jeremiah gave mock-ups for in the Discord channel...
I wanted to try to copy Delatorre's VanAnimation example, and that's kinda where I'm stuck right now. It looks like in the VanAnimcation example he started with the original GreatMaps (Gmap.NET) starter package, i.e. the thing you get when starting out with GMaps... the thing that has "Demo.WindowsForms", "Demo.WindowsPresentation", etc...
Mayb that's what I should do. Idk.
(Currently problem I have is when I run my Home_Visits_Vaccination program (use Form2) is a "System.NullReferenceException" when I try to get directions into a GMapRoute. (Line 102 in Form2.cs)
